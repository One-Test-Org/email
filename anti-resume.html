                            <p>My father was an engineer, he designed and build parts for large ships in a shipyard. My
                                mother was a photographer, she was a studio and occasions photographer. I grew up in a
                                small industrial town of 25000 people 11 miles from the capital of my country. It is
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusis"> Eleusis</a> (pronounced: 'elefsis').

                            <p>My mother's studio was so large that the air-force
                                had it commandeered it in case of war. Oh, yes our kind neighbours always flex their
                                muscles. The late seventies and early eighties were a time of change, I got to
                                experience this in a form of an amazing childhood. My father wanted us to have a lot of
                                different experiences. So, he got a VW T2 and turned it into a campervan. So skiing in
                                the winter and camping by a beach in the summer.</p>

                            <p>Moreover, things kept getting better and better. We started holidays abroad thanks and
                                due to the new found small increase in wealth my parents bought me my first computer and
                                it was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC_464">Amstrad cpc64.</a> It
                                was Christmas 1985 and I was 9 years old. I have never been without a computer since, or
                                2 or 3 or 18. The first couple of years I just played, with games and Basic. I liked
                                games, don't get me wrong. But at the time they were not as immersive or as addictive as
                                they are now, so they kind of bored me pretty quick.</p>

                            <p>So, I went to computer school as soon as I could, unfortunately the web had not been born

                                harder than you can imagine. The money paid for more equipment and I was already editing

                                Here's a picture of my father and I at Parnassus mountain, the last time we skied
                                together. And of our campervan, the one that took us on many adventures. </p>

                            <p>As every other young man in Greece, I had to do national service. A 23 month service in
                                the armed forces. Were I got to drive and maintain an <a

                                    personnel carrier</a>. I was stationed at the borders of Albania and Former

                            <p>Once I returned from service my father wisely got me in a college were I learned
                                Photoshop
                                and Premiere Pro, I did not learn much more about photography that I didn't already
                                know.
                                Unfortunately, those few years as a young man were wasted. Got in with the wrong crowd,
                                got a bit lost. Athens was not a good place for me at the time. I moved to Corfu where
                                my mother's family is from. I got a job as a Graphic Designer and met my wife. </p>

                            <p>When I first got into web design, it was because my late brother needed a website for his
                                business. I quickly managed to build one for him and then started building more and more
                                and more. Coding websites, in the simplest formats possible provided enough difficulty
                                to keep me in the <a

                                    state.</a> where the difficulty meets the skills and it constantly creates a linear
                                relationship between challenge and satisfaction. A few years later is when I became a
                                civil servant, thinking at the time that not having to use dark patterns and manipulate
                                users was a good place to be. It was for a while, but then I got hit with modern agile.

                        <article>
                            <p>Add to that the reality of Government red tape and lack of understanding from the SLT
                                about the importance of design and software development. I left the Civil Service in
                                2019
                                and started working as a contractor. Where the pay is high enough to patch the time
                                wasting
                                bureaucracy of modern Government agile development. Scrum, it literally turns my stomach
                                and I'm not even a developer.
                                There's a lot more to me than that, but I'm not going to tell you. As this will quickly
                                become a novel. In an nutshell I'm tired, of endless, aimless meetings. Of constantly
                                chucking unfinished work over the wall. Of being told what to do, by people that don't
                                know what they want. More than anything I'm tired of the bullshit, and the cherry on the
                                cake is that the Tax Man is taking around 55% of my pay (<a

                                make people happy to use. I want to provide for my family and live in a country that is
