                            <p>My father was an engineer, he designed and build parts for a shipyard. My
                                mother was a studio and occasions photographer. I grew up in a
                                small industrial town of 25000 people 11 miles from the capital of my country. It is

                            <p>My mother's studio was so large that the air-force
                                had it commandeered it in case of war. Oh, yes our kind neighbours always flex their
                                muscles. The late seventies and early eighties were a time of change, I got to
                                experience this in a form of an amazing childhood. My father wanted us to have a lot of
                                different experiences. So, he got a VW T2 and turned it into a campervan. So skiing in
                                the winter and camping by a beach in the summer.</p>

                            <p>Moreover, things kept getting better and better. We started holidays abroad thanks and
                                due to the new found small increase in wealth my parents bought me my first computer and
                                it was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC_464"

                                was Christmas 1985 and I was 9 years old. I have never been without a computer since, or
                                2 or 3 or 18. The first couple of years I just played, with games and Basic. I liked
                                games, don't get me wrong. But at the time they were not as immersive or as addictive as
                                they are now, so they kind of bored me pretty quick.</p>

                            <p>So, I went to computer school as soon as I could, unfortunately the web had not been born
                                yet and I started creating databases in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase"

                                harder than you can imagine. The money paid for more equipment and I was already editing
                                and audio dubbing video cassettes for my mother's photo shop.</p>

                                Here's a picture of my father and I at Parnassus mountain, the last time we skied

                                got a bit lost. Athens was not a good place for me at the time. I moved to Corfu where

                                hometown. The sunny Bolton in Greater Manchester. This was 2007 and things were no so
                                bad for both the UK and the EU, yet! When I first got into web design, it was
                                because my late brother needed a website for his
                                business. I quickly managed to build one for him and then started building more and more
                                and more. Coding websites, in the simplest formats possible provided enough difficulty
                                to keep me in the <a

                                But, I was not as good in the business side. Not as bad as my late brother, but I was
                                not as good as I could have been.
                                A few years later is when an opportunity appeared for a UX role in government. I became
                                a
                                Civil Servant, thinking at the time that not having to use dark patterns, deal with
                                customer demands and manipulate
                                users was a good place to be. Not having to deal with the business side was a good
                                thing.
                                It was for a while, but then I got hit with modern agile.

                            <p>I sometimes think when I listen to Jason and David, that the things they critisise are
                                far
                                worse in reality. It's one thing to be sitting on a bird's eye view of the situation,
                                but it's another to be in the trenches. In an nutshell I'm tired, of endless, aimless
                                meetings. Of constantly
                                chucking unfinished work over the wall. Of being told what to do, by people that don't
                                know what they are talking about or even what they want. More than anything I'm tired of
                                the bullshit, and the cherry on the
                                cake is that the Tax Man is taking around 55% of my pay (45% plus

                                I purchased a Campfire license some time ago and I have been using it for a family chat.

                                When I watched Jason Zimdars's talk on the CSS I was really
                                impressed, I was even more impressed looking at the code and reading his <a
                                    href="https://dev.37signals.com/modern-css-patterns-and-techniques-in-campfire/"
                                    target="_blank">blog</a>. I removed the campfire logo
                                and aligned everything to the left. So I started wondering. Could I learn all the new
                                CSS features, could I use them so coherently? My initial inner thought was 'DAMN that's
                                good!' but then I realised, if I had 4 good deep focus work hours per day. If I did not
                                have
                                chat's, emails, meetings, etc. Could I do it? <strong>Damn right I could!</strong>

                                In the past decade or so, I have designed some great apps. From public facing websites
                                used by millions of people to internal tools for a few hundred civil servants.
                                I am even building a <a href="https://design-prototypes.com/courses">Video tutorial CRUD
                                    app</a> for teaching others how to code government
                                services. I am using Next.js, <span class="text-highlight--dark"><strong>do not

                                told me once, on what I assume was a quick reply on
                                his
                                Hey mail. I want out. I want the freedom to go to where I am valued, to work with people
                                that know what they're doing. I want to be able to code, to design, to build things that
                                make people happy to use. I want to provide for my family and live in a country that is
                                not run by a bunch of self serving idiots. (Finding that country is not going to be
                                easy at all, but I am aiming for optionality here.)

                                cuts, the culture and climate will compensate for the lack of everything else. I will
