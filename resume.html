                                prototyping using the PDS design system and the core infrastructure in Parliament. I
                                spearheaded the adoption of an agile way of working to facilitate collaboration among
                                multidisciplinary teams and eliminate silos. Additionally, I provided design expertise
                                for a new product in the parliamentary web app ecosystem. Currently, I am part of the

                            <p>As a permanent staff member, I contributed to a high-impact, high-priority project for
                                the HMRC. My responsibilities included planning, designing, and prototyping using the
                                GDS prototype kit. I collaborated within a large, multi-disciplinary team following
                                Agile methodology. I was also involved in the digital transformation of Mercator,
                                revamping the identity and web presence for the Digital division. I spearheaded the
                                recruitment for Interaction designers by establishing a process for design and
                                prototyping tests more aligned with a developer coding test. I continued to serve as a
                                design assessor for GDS and created the HMRC standards by introducing a 3-part approach
                                to Design Ops, which included Design critiques, Design Histories, and Pair programming.
                                Ultimately, I led 12 teams of around 35 UCD people from a strategic perspective in terms
                                of how to grow the design functions using the 3-part approach for the Newcastle HMRC
                                hub. This approach spread to other HMRC digital hubs.

                                contributor and progressing to leading teams in co-creating user-centric solutions. My
                                responsibilities included gathering requirements, facilitating workshops and design
                                sprints, and supporting the establishment of design standards. I also took on additional
                                responsibilities in training, recruitment, and resource planning. I actively
                                participated in GDS assessments as a design assessor. Furthermore, I co-created an
                                internal assessment process to ensure both internal and external-facing services met the
                                GDS Standard and applied accessibility audits to ensure all services were prepared for
                                external assessments or met the relevant criteria even if they did not require one.
                                Eventually I led 4 Digital teams of 10-12 UCD practitioners.
