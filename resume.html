                                revamping the identity and web presence for the Digital division. I spearheaded the
                                recruitment for Interaction designers by establishing a process for design and
                                prototyping tests more aligned with a developer coding test. I continued to serve as

                                of how to grow the design functions using the 3-part approach for the Newcastle HMRC
